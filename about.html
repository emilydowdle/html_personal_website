			<h1>About</h1>

			<p>Hi, I'm Emily. </p>

			<p>I'm a freelance writer and content marketing strategist over at <a href="http://www.editingemily.com">Editing Emily</a>. </p>

			<p>My next challenge is learning to program in Ruby. </p>

			<h2>Professional Experience</h2>

			<p>I believe words are powerful.</p>

			<p>Words do more than convey a message. They shape perception. Words soften hearts and change minds.</p>

			<p><i>That</i> is why I work with business owners to better engage their customers.</p>

			<p>I show customers the people behind the brand. The passion. The work. That shared experience is far more powerful than any 30-second spot on TV. It earns customer loyalty for life. </p>
			
			<h2>Values</h2>

			<p>I'm a competitive powerlifter. </p>

			<p>No, I'm not big and burly. But you'd be surprised at how many dentists show up to a powerlifting meet.</p>

			<p>Powerlifting is hard work. There's no way to cheat. Your success in the sport is determined by how many hours you spend moving iron at the gym.</p>

			<p>I've learned a lot on the short walk from the chalk bucket to the platform. Those lessons have formed the foundation of my work ethic. </p>

			<p>My value system is based on 10 basic principles.</p>

			<ol>
			<li>Always show up.</li>
			<li>Smile, even on the bad days.</li>
			<li>Work consistently toward one goal.</li>
			<li>Appreciate slow progression.</li>
			<li>Learn from others.</li>
			<li>Hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard.</li>
			<li>Setbacks are part of the journey.</li>
			<li>Ask for help when it's needed.</li>
			<li>Never, ever give up.</li>
			<li>Deeply value collaboration.</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Do You Like Goats?</h2>

			<p>Because I'm mildly obsessed with them.</p>

			<p>I genuinely enjoy documentaries &mdash; especially about finance. If you haven't seen <i>Hank,</i> you should.</p>

			<p>The rest of my Netflix queue is filled with foreign TV shows. Not in a snobby way. (Who likes snobs?!) It's just that BBC makes shows that NBC would cancel after 5 episodes.</p>

			<p>I love facts. Half my sentences start with "Did you know?" And I really mean it.</p>

			<p>Do you have a fun fact I should know? <a href="mailto:emily@editingemily.com">Email me!</a></p>
